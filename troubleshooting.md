# The nuclear option

If you believe that you successfully deployed the NIVM, but you still can't login with x2go (error msg about non-existent fsl directory), or non of the neuroimaging packages are installed, follow the following steps:

1. Try again
2. If that didn't work, connect to the VM via SSH
3. While logged in, clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/wmpauli/NIVM`
4. Manually execute the installation script: `bash install.sh`
